Description

Design will approximate the power produced by a system of thermoelectric generators in a tube or smokestack. 
Additionally, various monetary approximations can be made, such as throughput. The idea is to assist
engineers in producing commercially viable thermoelectric generators. Thermal conductivity, resistivity, and 
Seebeck coefficient of your bulk thermoelectric material, as functions of temperature, are the only input data 
needed for this simulation. Other inputs are parameters.


How to use this software

Before using this software, it is imperative that:
kappa_func_T(), Seebeck_func_T(), rho_func_T(), and Tau() are defined by YOU in the file integrate.cpp.
They must be defined as polynomials in c++ language, so fit your data to polynomials before using this software.
Example polynomials are included already.

The file named "options" contains input parameters. Only the numeric values should be changed for your system.
Heat fins refer to the "fins" on a heat sink. It is assumed that 2 heat sinks accompany each thermoelectric
generator (TEG): one to absorb heat and another to dissipate it. 


How to compile (in linux)

The boost, tnt, and jama libraries need to be included when compiling using g++. 
Alter the makefile and header locations to your situation.
make
